          <h3>Bio</h3>
          <p>I am a graduate student. I will attend Marist Graduate school at the end of August. I will be working towards my M.S. degree in software development. I recently graduated from Suny Poly with a B.S. degree in network and computer security. I graduated
          with a 3.94, the highest GPA of my graduating peers with the same major, summa cum laude.
          </p>
          <p>
          I plan on working hard to attain my master's degree. I want to learn as much as I can, and make myself a well rounded individual when it comes to the field of computer science. I know a lot about networking, and computer security. I am also CCENT certified.
          Now I plan to learn a lot about software development. I hope to be as varied as possible so that I can overcome any obstacle that comes my way.
